With the development of the Blindo project, members commited themselves to the creation of an electronic device, the purpose being to simplify the learning process of visually impaired students.

The versatility of the device enables for its use in numerous educational domains.
The Blindo device allows managing the association of audio files to specific buttons in a simple and intuitive manner for both categories of users.

Blind users can select one or more buttons to reproduce the corresponding associated audio files through headphones or external speakers.

Sighted users can choose an option they find more appropriate for educational purposes: they can either record an audio file using an external microphone, or import an existing file from an external USB device.

The button-file association phase is possible thanks to an intuitive and smooth graphical interface, which also allows sighted users to customise the device’s structure at their own pleasure.

This device includes a capacitive touch screen to improve user experience.

The project was accomplished with Raspberry Pi 3, a single-board computer entirely programmed in Python.
